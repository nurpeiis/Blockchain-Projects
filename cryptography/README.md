- To visualize how much harder it is to break, Lenstra recently introduced the concept of [Global Security](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/635.pdf).
  - By this measure, breaking a 228-bit RSA key requires less energy to than it takes to boil a teaspoon of water. Comparatively, breaking a 228-bit elliptic curve key requires enough energy to boil all the water on earth. For this level of security with RSA, you'd need a key with 2,380-bits.
